## Introduction

The **Animated Hamburger Menu** is a web design element that uses SVG graphics to create a visually engaging menu icon that transitions smoothly when clicked. The menu icon consists of a series of SVG paths that form the shape of a hamburger. When the user clicks on the menu icon, it triggers an animation that transforms the hamburger shape into a different pattern, providing a visual cue to the user that the menu has been clicked.
